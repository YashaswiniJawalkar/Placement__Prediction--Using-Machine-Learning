# Placement__Prediction--Using-Machine-Learning 
[Visit here](https://yashaswiniproject101.onrender.com).
The project aims to predict the likelihood of a student being placed in a company based on historical placement data, academic records, and relevant skills of students. It provides valuable insights to both students and recruiters, enhancing the placement process and increasing overall job satisfaction.

## Overview

This Flask-based project utilizes a Logistic Regression model to predict job placements for students. It features a web interface where users can input their academic and personal details to obtain a prediction regarding their likelihood of being placed.

### Dataset and Features

The project employs a dataset containing various features:

- gender
- ssc_p: Secondary Education percentage
- hsc_p: Higher Secondary Education percentage
- hsc_s: Specialization in Higher Secondary Education
 degree_p: Degree percentage
- degree_t: Type of Undergraduate Degree
- workex: Work experience
- etest_p: Employability test percentage
- specialisation: MBA specialization
- mba_p: MBA percentage

  
## Features

- **Prediction Route**: `/send` accepts form inputs and predicts placement chances.
- **User Interface**: HTML templates (`index.html`, `predict.html`, `show.html`) for user interaction.
- **Model**: `logreg_model.pkl` file contains the trained Logistic Regression model.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
